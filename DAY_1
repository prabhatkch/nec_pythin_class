#HomeWork --- Write five uses of list with proper examples
Here are five different uses of lists in Python, each accompanied by a short example:

1. Storing Multiple Items:
Lists can store multiple items in a single variable. They can hold different data types.

CODE:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)

OUTPUT:
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

2. Accessing Elements:
You can access elements in a list by their index.

CODE:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[1])

OUTPUT:
banana

3. Modifying Elements:
Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content.

CODE:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits[1] = "blueberry"
print(fruits)

OUTPUT:
['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry']

4. Appending Elements:
You can add elements to the end of a list using the append() method.

CODE:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("orange")
print(fruits)

OUTPUT:
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']

5. Iterating Through a List:
You can loop through the items in a list using a for loop.

CODE:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

OUTPUT
# apple
# banana
# cherry


#HomeWork --- Write five programs using the math library

Here are five programs using the Python math library, each illustrating a different function from the library:

1. Calculating the Square Root:

CODE:
import math

number = 16
sqrt_value = math.sqrt(number)
print(f"The square root of {number} is {sqrt_value}")

OUTPUT:
The square root of 16 is 4.0


2. Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):

CODE:
import math

num1 = 48
num2 = 180
gcd_value = math.gcd(num1, num2)
print(f"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {gcd_value}")

OUTPUT:
The GCD of 48 and 180 is 12


3. Calculating the Factorial:

CODE:
import math

number = 5
factorial_value = math.factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {factorial_value}")

OUTPUT:
The factorial of 5 is 120


4. Using Trigonometric Functions:

CODE:
import math

angle_degrees = 30
angle_radians = math.radians(angle_degrees)
sine_value = math.sin(angle_radians)
cosine_value = math.cos(angle_radians)
print(f"sin({angle_degrees}째) is {sine_value}")
print(f"cos({angle_degrees}째) is {cosine_value}")

OUTPUT:
# sin(30째) is 0.49999999999999994
# cos(30째) is 0.8660254037844387


5. Calculating the Exponential and Logarithm:

CODE:
import math

number = 2
exp_value = math.exp(number)
log_value = math.log(exp_value)
print(f"e^{number} is {exp_value}")
print(f"log({exp_value}) is {log_value}")

OUTPUT:
# e^2 is 7.3890560989306495
# log(7.3890560989306495) is 2.0
